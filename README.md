# gnome-keyring-import-export
An updated version of https://bitbucket.org/spookylukey/gnome-keyring-import-export

There are other versions of this script floating around - but this modified version worked for me on Ubuntu 18.04.

Requires python3-keyring and gir1.2-gnomekeyring-1.0 libraries. I've not touched the Firefox exporter code, so that may not work.
